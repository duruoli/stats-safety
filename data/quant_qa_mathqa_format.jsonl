More specifically, the P(A) = valid/total, where the numerator denotes the number of valid ways event A can occur, and total denotes the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe denominator is simply the total number of poker hands, of the number of ways you can be dealt 5 cards from 52. Namely, it's equal to (52 choose 5).\n\nThe numerator, however, is a little more challenging, and asks us to count the number of valid ways for a straight to occur.\n\nLet's start this calculation by suit. Given that we have cards A, 2, 3, 4, 5, what are the total number of valid suit arrangements?\n\nWell, for each of the 5 ranks, we have 4 suits. This gives us 4^5 total arrangements of suits. However, we must remember that a condition of a straight is that all 5 cards cannot share the same suit. This means we must subtract 4^5 by 4, for the 4 invalid ways. The 4 possible invalid suit arrangements are if all card Ace through 5 have suit clubs, or suit diamonds, or suit hearts, or suit spades. We subtract this from 4^5 to get our final expression, 4^5 - 4, for the number of valid suit arrangements, given a correct rank arrangement.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of valid rank arrangements. We can do this with basic enumeration (counting). First, we have Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. After, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

{"id": "Four of a Kind", "Problem": "What is the probability of drawing 4 of a kind from a standard 5-card hand?", "Rationale": "This problem reduces to the number of ways to get a 4 of a kind in a poker hand. When approaching counting problems of such a nature (number of poker hands, number of outfits etc.), I find it's best to generalize. In this case, whether the 4 of a kind is an Ace, a 2, or a King, the type of hand is unaffected. And the fifth and final card can be any of the remaining 48 cards. We can generalize a valid hand as such: {A A A A B}, where A represents one rank, and B represents a different rank of any suit. There are 13 valid ways to choose A, because there are 13 possible ranks in a standard deck of cards. Once we've chosen all 4 cards of rank A, there are 48 remaining cards, and any of them can serve as a valid B. As a result, the number of ways to get a four-of-a-kind hand is 13 * 48 = 624.\n\nTo prove the above counting method is valid, here's an alternative implementation. Another possible arrangement is {A B B B B}, where we first select our single, and then choose the quad. There are 52 ways to first choose our single: it can be any card in the deck. Then, however, when choosing the quad, it can be any rank except rank A. This is because there are only 3 cards of rank A left, making it impossible to form a quad. That leaves us with 12 possible ranks for B. Multiplying across gives us the the number of ways count a valid four-of-a-kind hand: 52 * 12 = 624.\n\nAs you can see, the number of ways to count valid hands is equivalent regardless of which rank we assign to be the quad or the single. This problem is not yet complete though because we are asked to compute the probability of drawing such a hand. Thus, we must divide the number of valid four-of-a-kinds by the number of possible poker hands. The number of valid poker hands is given by the number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52, namely (52 choose 5) or 2598960. Thus:\n\nP(4 of a kind) = 624/2598960 = 0.024%", "correct": "624/2598960, 0.024%, 0.00024", "annotated_formula": "", "linear_formula": "", "category": "probability"}

Intuitively, the greater our current sum, the less we should want to re-roll based on the risk of losing a lot. We should only re-roll when the value of re-rolling is greater than cashing out our current earnings risk free.\n\nLet's call our current earnings x.

If player B rolls a sum of 7, they win. If neither rolls their desired value, the game continues until someone wins. What is the probability that player A wins?", "Rationale": "To begin, let's start by considering the probability of rolling a sum of 6 with two dice and the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two dice.\n\nWe can roll a six in the following ways: 1&5,\n5&1,\n2&4,\n4&2,\n3&3. Since there are 36 total ways to roll two dice, the probability of rolling a sum of 6 is 5/36. We can do the same for rolling a sum of 7. A seven can be rolled in the following ways: 1&6,\n6&1,\n2&5,\n5&2,\n3&4,\n4&3. This gives us the probability of rolling a sum of 7 as 6/36 = 1/6.\n\nBased on this information, you may be inclined to believe that player B will win the game because the probability of rolling a 7 is larger than the probability of rolling a 6. However, there's one important part of this problem that you must remember - player A goes first. Therefore, we want to investigate whether the advantage of going first offsets the lower probability associated with rolling a sum of 6.\n\nPlayer A can win the game in the following ways:\n\n1. Player A rolls a sum of 6 on their first roll.\n2. Player A fails to roll a sum of 6 on their first roll, then player B fails to roll a sum of 7, and then player A rolls a sum of 6.\n\nNote that pattern #2 can continue indefinitely as long as player A eventually rolls a sum of 6 before player B rolls a sum of 7. In essence, there is a sequence of events that take place with some k number of failures until we encounter the first success of player A rolling a 6. The process we just described can be modeled by the geometric distribution.\n\nLet p_A = 5/36 be the probability that player A rolls a 6, and p_B = 6/36 = 1/6 be the probability that player B rolls a 7.\n\nThe probability that player A wins on their first roll is p_A = 5/36.\n\nThe probability that player A wins on their second turn (after both players fail on their first turns) is (1-p_A)(1-p_B)(p_A) = (31/36)(5/6)(5/36).\n\nThe probability that player A wins on their third turn is (1-p_A)(1-p_B)(1-p_A)(1-p_B)(p_A) = (31/36)(5/6)(31/36)(5/6)(5/36).\n\nThis pattern continues, forming a geometric series. The sum of this infinite series gives us the total probability that player A wins:\n\nP(A wins) = p_A + (1-p_A)(1-p_B)p_A + (1-p_A)(1-p_B)(1-p_A)(1-p_B)p_A + ...\n\nThis can be simplified to:\nP(A wins) = p_A / [\n    1 - (1-p_A)(1-p_B)\n]\nTherefore, the probability that player A wins is 30/61.", "correct": "30/61", "annotated_formula": "", "linear_formula": "", "category": "probability"}

It's key to realize that we are given a piece of information: that the cube in question has 5 visible white faces. The sixth face is lying face down, and as a result we cannot know whether it is white or red. This implies that the cube in question can either be the center cube, or it could be one of the six cubes which have exactly one red face and that red face happens to be lying face down, leaving 5 visible white faces.\n\nComprehending the implication of the given information is essential to solving the problem. Given this piece of information, we are asked to compute the probability that the cube in question is the one from the center ie. the one with 6 white faces. Since we are asked to compute the probability of an event given some information, we can use Bayes' Rule:\n\nA := cube we see is center cube\n\nB := cube in question has 5 visible white faces\n\nP(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B)/P(B) = P(A)/P(B)\n\nThe second equality comes from the fact that if the cube in question is the center one, then it is guaranteed to have 5 visible white faces showing no matter its orientation on the ground. As a result, the probability reduces to P(A).\n\nThe P(A) is equal to the probability that we see the center cube. Since there are 27 cubes, this probability is 1/27.\n\nThe P(B) is the probability that the cube on the ground has 5 visible white faces. There are only 7 total cubes for which this is possible (the single center cube with 6 white faces, and the 6 cubes in the center of each face, with only 1 red face). P(B) is the collective sum of these two disjoint sets. There are 6 cubes with 1 red face, each occurring with probability 1/27, and each with probability 1/6 of being red face down, making them validly show 5 white faces. Multiplying through, we get: 6 * 1/27 * 1/6 = 1/27\n\nThe probability of the center cube occurring and being in a valid orientation is simply 1/27 because it will properly show 5 white face in any of it's six orientations.\n\nAdding these two value together we get our P(B) = 1/27 + 1/27 = 2/27\n\nPlugging this back into our original equation, we get:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/27)/(2/27) = 1/2", "correct": "1/2", "annotated_formula": "", "linear_formula": "", "category": "probability"}

We can use the Law of Total Probability to split the calculation of expectation into a weighted average of two parts: one which corresponds to the number of flips if we first get a head, and the other the number of flips which correspond to a tail. This yields the following sum:\n\nE(X\u2081) = P(Tail) * [\n    1 + E(X\u2081)\n] + P(Head) * 1\n\nAs you can see from the sum above, if we get a tails we essentially 'restart' and, we're left summing the single tails flip (1) and the expected number of flips to get 1 head, E(X\u2081).

This corresponds to the event that the length of the smallest of the 3 pieces, or min(x, y-x,\n1-y), is at most 0.2, or less than or equal to 0.2.\n\nThe first key observation to solving this problem is to recognize that P(min(x, y-x,\n1-y) <= 0.2) is equal to 1 - P(x, y-x,\n1-y \u2265 0.2). This is by the complement rule. The complement to the event upper bounding the minimum, is the event that all are above the minimum.

{"id": "How Many Heads", "Problem": "There are three coins in a hat. One with probability 1/3 of getting heads, another with probability 2/3 of heads, and the last coin always landing on heads. I take one out and flip it twice landing on heads both times. If I flip the coin twelve more times, how many heads do you expect among these flips?", "Rationale": "To find the expected number of heads in the next n flips, we need to have an idea of which coin has been selected. Using the condition that both flips were heads, we can compute the conditional probability of each coin. The probability of two heads is the union of the probabilities of getting two heads for each coin.\n\nP(2H) = 1/3(1/3)\u00b2 + 1/3(2/3)\u00b2 + 1/3(1)\u00b2 = 14/27\n\nThe probability the 1/3 coin was selected is: 1/3(1/3)\u00b2/(14/27) = 1/14\n\nSimilarly the probability the 2/3 coin was picked is: 1/3(2/3)\u00b2/(14/27) = 4/14\n\nLeaving the probability the always heads coin is picked to be 9/14. Now that we know the probability of each coin being selected, we can find the expected number of heads in the next twelve flips. If we have a coin with probability p to land on heads, we can expect 12p heads.

If we finish picking apples before oranges and peaches, we know a < o and a < p. There exist two ways where we can satisfy this joint condition. Either a < o < p or a < p < o. Let's compute the probability of each.\n\nIn the case where we finish picking apples before oranges and oranges before peaches, peaches are what would be finished last. Because we are picking at random, each individual fruit has an equal probability of being the last fruit. Out of the 60 total fruits,\n30 of them are peaches. Thus the probability the very last fruit is a peach is 30/60 or 1/2. We now need to find the probability that oranges are finished being picked after apples conditioned upon peaches being the last fruit picked from the basket. Between apples and oranges there are a total of 30 fruits, oranges being 20 of them, thus our conditional probability is P(a < o|p = 60) = 2/3. The joint probability of these outcomes is: 1/2 \u00b7 2/3 = 1/3\n\nDoing something similar for the case where we finish picking apples before peaches and peaches before oranges we get a probability of 1/3 of the last fruit being an orange and a probability of 3/4 of finishing apples before peaches when oranges are last giving us a joint probability of: 1/3 \u00b7 3/4 = 1/4\n\nThe probability that either of these occur is the sum of these probabilities and so our answer is: 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12", "correct": "7/12", "annotated_formula": "", "linear_formula": "", "category": "probability"}

There are 3! = 6 ways to order the 3 shots such that one lands in each of the 3 rings (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA).\n\nWe can calculate the probability of each event A, B, and C using relative areas. The area of the total target space is 12\u00b2\u03c0. The area of A is 4\u00b2\u03c0. Therefore,\n\nP(A) = 4\u00b2\u03c0/12\u00b2\u03c0 = 16/144 = 1/9.\n\nP(B) can be found by computing the area of only the second ring, and dividing by the area of the whole circle. The area of only the second ring is the area of the second circle minus the area of the inner circle: 8\u00b2\u03c0 - 4\u00b2\u03c0 = 48\u03c0.

Thus,\n\nP(A = B) = 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64...\n\n\u2192 4P(A = B) = 1 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64...\n\nSubtracting the top from bottom we see: 3P(A = B) = 1\n\n\u2192 P(A = B) = 1/3\n\nUsing this we compute:\n\nP(A < B) = (1 - 1/3)/2 = 1/3\n\nWe can now compute P(A = n|A < B). If Alice flips her coin once, we know that she must get a heads on the first flip and Bob must get a tails on his first flip. If she flips her coin twice, she gets a heads followed by tails and Bob gets tails for his first two flips and so on. Our conditional expectations:\n\nE[A|A < B] = (1/2 \u00b7 1/2)/(1/3)(1) + (1/4 \u00b7 1/4)/(1/3)(2) + (1/8 \u00b7 1/8)/(1/3)(3)... = 3/4(1) + 3/16(2) + 3/64(3)...\n\n= 3/4(1) + 3/16(2) + 3/64(3)...\n\nWe can compute 4E[A|A < B] - E[A|A < B] as:\n\n4E[A|A < B] = 3(1) + 3/4(2) + 3/16(3) + 3/64(4)...\n\n4E[A|A < B] - E[A|A < B] = 3E[A|A < B] = 3 + 3/4 + 3/16 + 3/64...\n\nSimilarly we compute:\n\n12E[A|A < B] = 12 + 3 + 3/4 + 3/16 + 3/64...\n\n12E[A|A < B] - 3E[A|A < B] = 9E[A|A < B] = 12\n\n\u27f9 E[A|A < B] = 4/3", "correct": "4/3", "annotated_formula": "", "linear_formula": "", "category": "probability"}
{"id": "First Steps", "Problem": "A baby is learning to walk with the assistance of its living room couch. The baby starts at the couch and at each given time the baby will make a decision. It will either take a brave step forward, stand in place not knowing what to do, or fearfully take a step back towards the couch with probabilities 0.2,\n0.5, and 0.3 respectively. The baby will never go behind the couch (so when at the couch the baby has probability 0.2 of moving forward and probability 0.8 of staying at the couch).\nIf you were to observe this baby for an extremely long amount of time, what proportion of the time would the baby be at the couch?", "Rationale": "Suppose we create a state diagram with states S\u2080, S\u2081, ...S\u2099 where S\u2099 represents the time a baby spends at the state n steps from the couch. Using our decision matrix [\n    0.2,\n    0.5,\n    0.3\n], we can map the state diagram of the baby. The baby will be at the couch, or S\u2080, after being at the S\u2080 in the previous state and standing still or moving back towards the couch from S\u2081. Thus,\n\nS\u2080 = 0.8S\u2080 + 0.3S\u2081\n\nSimilarly, we get:\n\nS\u2081 = 0.2S\u2080 + 0.5S\u2081 + 0.3S\u2082\nS\u2082 = 0.2S\u2081 + 0.5S\u2082 + 0.3S\u2083\nS\u2083 = 0.2S\u2082 + 0.5S\u2083 + 0.3S\u2084\n\u22ee\nS\u2099 = 0.2S\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 0.5S\u2099 + 0.3S\u2099\u208a\u2081\n\nBy simplifying these equations, we can identify a pattern:\n\nS\u2080 = 0.8S\u2080 + 0.3S\u2081 \u27f6 S\u2080 = 1.5S\u2081\n\nSubstituting in 1.5S\u2081 into our S\u2081 equation we get:\n\nS\u2081 = 0.2(1.5S\u2081) + 0.5S\u2081 + 0.3S\u2082 \u27f6 S\u2081 = 1.5S\u2082\n\nIt is evident that all subsequent state equations can be re-written as S\u2099 = 1.5S\u2099\u208a\u2081 What that tells us is the baby will spend \u00b2\u2044\u2083 as much time in S\u2099\u208a\u2081 compared to S\u2099. We know that all these states must sum to one and have common ratio \u00b2\u2044\u2083.
