            "To solve this, let's analyze the situation. The bear will catch 3 fish and then leave. So, the sequence of catching a fish will stop after the third fish. Since the bear catches the first three fish, the fifth fish isn't the next fish in the sequence. The fourth fish in the correct sequence is the next to be caught. Ultimately, the fifth fish will be caught after the bear comes back. The probability of the bear not catching the fifth fish when a fish comes is 1/2. However, the question asks about the fifth fish. Since the sequence will occur over two separate instances of the bear being at the river, we need to consider all possible paths for the bear's two trips. Ultimately, the probability of the bear catching 3, not the fifth, on the first trip and catching it on the next is (1/2)^3*(1/2). The probability of catching 3 on the second trip and the fifth fish on the first trip is (1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2). So the probability is (1/2)^5. <answer> 1/32 </answer> \n",

The expected amount of steps in this case is 2+1=3. Alternatively, if we draw the red orb (with probability 2/3), we still have to draw it out and then replace it with a blue orb. The probability of that is 2/3. In that case, the expected amount of steps is 2 + (2+1)=5.

            "When drawing two cards, there's a probability of 10/19 that they will not match (since 10 out of the 19 possible combinations don't match up). This is because out of the 19 combinations you can draw, there are 100 cards (20 cards times 5 combinations of drawing the two cards). 100 cards minus the 10 that pair up gives us the 90 cards where no match occurs. (We can also think of it as (20C2)/(19C2) = (20*19)/(2*1) = 190/19, but this gives 190/19 which isn't the probability we are looking for but 10/19).\n",

            "In the second step, we will have one less card, so the probability of not matching will change to 18/19. However, since we are looking at the expected number of turns, we are taking the expected value of a geometric distribution.\n",

            "Let X be the expected number of turns. We can write the equation E(X) = 1 + E(X). To put this equation in a more usable form, we have to remember that E(X) = ‚àë(x P(x)), where each x is a possible number of turns.\n",

So if the game started right now, I would expect, on average, it would take 20.49 turns.

So, the chance of catching 3 fish would be (1/2)^3, but we are interested in the opposite outcome.
